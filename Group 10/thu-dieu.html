      <h2>🌊 About Me 🌊</h2>
      <p>Hello, I’m Nguyen Thu Dieu, known as the Commander & Blue Strategist of our team.
        I thrive on structure, analysis, and smart planning. I love solving problems and finding efficient paths to success.
        In my free time, I enjoy chess, documentaries, and writing strategic plans for fun!
        Precision and calm are my superpowers—I believe every goal needs a map.
        Let’s plan well and execute even better.</p>

        <h3>Building Smart Solutions Together</h3>
        <p>LogicBridge is a problem-solving challenge that brings together diverse student teams to tackle real issues facing their schools or communities—such as waste reduction, student engagement, or digital learning. Each team is guided by mentors and supported by data analysis tools and workshops in systems thinking. Final solutions are implemented in pilot phases, and winning teams receive support to scale their ideas. This project champions analytical leadership and collaborative execution, which I guide with strategic foresight and steady decision-making.</p>

        <h3>Guiding the Way with Positivity</h3>
        <p>BrightPath is a mentorship and life-coaching initiative that connects high school students with inspiring university mentors. The program includes bi-weekly mentoring sessions, personal goal mapping, and life skill workshops on topics like time management, emotional intelligence, and values-based decision-making. Each student completes the journey with a written vision statement and action plan. As Captain, I steer the BrightPath community with optimism, ensuring every participant walks away with clarity, confidence, and a mentor for life.</p>
