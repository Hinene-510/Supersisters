        <h3>Shining Light on Everyday Heroes</h3>
        <p>SunWatch is a multimedia storytelling project that uncovers the acts of kindness and resilience hidden in everyday life. Through interviews, videos, and photo essays, we spotlight teachers, sanitation workers, youth volunteers, and others who quietly shape the community. Each month, we publish a digital "Hero Feature" and invite the public to submit nominations. SunWatch fosters gratitude and uplifts morale, especially during tough times. As the Yellow Guardian, I serve as the project‚Äôs guiding light, reminding us that small acts often make the biggest difference.</p>

        <h3>Guiding the Way with Positivity</h3>
        <p>BrightPath is a mentorship and life-coaching initiative that connects high school students with inspiring university mentors. The program includes bi-weekly mentoring sessions, personal goal mapping, and life skill workshops on topics like time management, emotional intelligence, and values-based decision-making. Each student completes the journey with a written vision statement and action plan. As Captain, I steer the BrightPath community with optimism, ensuring every participant walks away with clarity, confidence, and a mentor for life.</p>
