      <h2>🌊 About Me 🌊</h2>
      <p>Hello, I’m Nguyen Thu Dieu, known as the Commander & Blue Strategist of our team.
        I thrive on structure, analysis, and smart planning. I love solving problems and finding efficient paths to success.
        In my free time, I enjoy chess, documentaries, and writing strategic plans for fun!
        Precision and calm are my superpowers—I believe every goal needs a map.
        Let’s plan well and execute even better.</p>

        <h3>Design. Decide. Deliver.</h3>
        <p>MindMap Mission is a strategy-based bootcamp where students learn how to transform abstract ideas into well-structured, executable projects. We use real-world case studies and tools like SWOT, Gantt charts, and decision matrices to teach strategic thinking. Participants work in teams to design a project proposal, complete with timelines, budgets, and KPIs, then pitch to a mock board of evaluators. As Commander & Blue Strategist, I ensure participants think with clarity and precision, developing solutions that are both innovative and realistic.</p>

        <h3>Building Smart Solutions Together</h3>
        <p>LogicBridge is a problem-solving challenge that brings together diverse student teams to tackle real issues facing their schools or communities—such as waste reduction, student engagement, or digital learning. Each team is guided by mentors and supported by data analysis tools and workshops in systems thinking. Final solutions are implemented in pilot phases, and winning teams receive support to scale their ideas. This project champions analytical leadership and collaborative execution, which I guide with strategic foresight and steady decision-making.</p>
