      <h2>💖 About Me 💖</h2>
      <p>Hi! My name is Trinh Tra Vinh, and I proudly stand as the Chief & Pink Flame.
        I’m deeply passionate about emotional intelligence, creativity, and empowering others through empathy.
        I love music, writing, and working on community art projects.
        I believe leadership can be soft yet powerful, and kindness can be revolutionary.
        Let’s light up the world—one spark of inspiration at a time.</p>

      <div class="project">
        <h3>Art That Speaks from the Soul</h3>
        <p>HeartBeat is an expressive arts movement that invites youth to explore their emotions and social identities through creative storytelling. Participants choose a medium—poetry, music, painting, dance, or short film—to convey personal journeys, cultural experiences, or causes they care about. We hold seasonal showcases and publish an online magazine called The HeartBeat Journal. The project emphasizes healing through art, emotional awareness, and shared humanity. As the Pink Flame, I nurture a compassionate space where creativity becomes a powerful tool for connection and self-love.</p>

        <h3>Empowering Self-Worth from Within</h3>
        <p>InnerGlow is a personal development program designed to build emotional resilience, self-worth, and inner peace. Through guided journaling, mindfulness sessions, vulnerability circles, and storytelling workshops, participants learn to embrace who they are and celebrate their uniqueness. We also run campaigns on social media to de-stigmatize mental health and encourage emotional expression. As the Chief, I lead this with heart-centered leadership, believing that self-love is the foundation for lasting empowerment and compassionate leadership.</p>
