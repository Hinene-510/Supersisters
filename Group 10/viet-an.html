      <h2>🔥 About Me 🔥</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Nguyen Thi Viet An, and I’m honored to be the Leader & Red Warrior of our team.
        I’m passionate about taking initiative, building strong teams, and inspiring others to push their limits.
        I enjoy public speaking, volunteering, and learning about leadership psychology.
        My energy comes from facing challenges head-on and turning ideas into action.
        Let’s charge forward together with courage and determination!</p>

        <h3>Where Passion Meets Action</h3>
        <p>FireSteps is a transformative leadership development bootcamp designed for high school and university students who want to lead with passion and purpose. The program includes three phases: ignite (self-discovery and motivation), challenge (group leadership simulations and outdoor team missions), and impact (designing and leading a mini community project). Participants gain hands-on experience in leadership, crisis management, and team dynamics. As the Red Warrior, I lead this project to awaken inner strength and help young leaders step into their potential with boldness.</p>

        <h3>Voices That Spark Change</h3>
        <p>Ignite Talks is a youth-led public speaking platform where students present powerful 5-minute speeches on issues they care deeply about—ranging from social justice to personal transformation. We host monthly open-mic events and annual competitions that blend storytelling with leadership training. Participants receive coaching on delivery, emotional intelligence, and stage presence. The goal is to empower a generation of changemakers to speak up and lead with courage. As the Leader & Red Warrior, I mentor the speakers and set the tone for fearless, impactful expression.</p>
